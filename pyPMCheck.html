<h1>Priming Effects Checker (cross-line)</h1>
<p>tired of configuring python?</p>
<p>mdo tries to make online digital calculations that were done by python before, so you do not need to set up python on your computer — all you need is to open this website. For those python apps that are not migrated online, digital information including introductions, how-tos and sample data/output are made online, so you do not have to transfer and update scripts via instant messengers.</p>
